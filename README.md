# Features
* Local JSON Data: Store and retrieve item data from a local JSON file.
* Dynamic List Rendering: Display data using ListView.builder for efficient list management.
* Hero Animation: Smooth transition animations between list items and detail views.
* Model Class: Use a model class to represent item data and simplify JSON decoding.
